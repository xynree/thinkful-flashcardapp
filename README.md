# Flashcards App (Thinkful)

An app for creating, viewing and updating flashcards, which utilizes the local API to perform CRUD requests in order to alter data on the server.

## Usage

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

Servers will start on `localhost:3000` and `localhost:8080` for the UI and the API respectively.

## Technologies Used

Written in React with [React Router v5](https://reactrouter.com/). Uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) with [Open-Iconic](https://useiconic.com/open) for styling. The backend tests are written with Jest and use json-server for the API.

## Credits

[Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/) created the starter repository for this project, which consists of the backend API and tests for the project.
